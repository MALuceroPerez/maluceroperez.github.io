## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
Images are rendered by default as inline block elements. When positioning a block element below them, a space is often left between the elements.
Previously, I used negative margin to close the gap. For this project, I displayed the image as a block. This removed the space between the elements.

I learned that flexbox makes controlling the size of your component difficult, if the component itself is a flex item.  
 

### Continued development

Continue building layouts and components. Will be attempting a more difficult challenge after the next one.
